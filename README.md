## About ##

Hello and welcome to my project! This is a game that is inspired by older games (around 1970s) and is supposed to imitate old terminal based games.
The game in itself is extremely bare bones and doesnt have much features but I have tried my best to make it modular so if you wish to fork it - go ahead! :D

## Features ##
This game comes with a ton of different features such as loading and saving which allows for you to carry on where you left off. It does this by
reading and writing to a json file initally created when you first save the game

A **shop** where you can purchase different gear like armor which reduces the amount of damage taken from traps and enemies and swords which deals more
damage to enemies!

It also features a **crafting** system where you can craft exclusive gear using materials that you can randomly find by 'exploring' the map!
Using potions from the **shop** to your advantage you can find more materials easier!

## Why go open source?
Coding is my passion and I'm excited to what people will do with this, If you don't understand anything please DM me or if we share a mutual server dont be affraid
to ping me! my discord is m.a.ad if you wish to contact me!

**OR**

Open a new terminal session and navigate to the Directory you want to save the file to and paste this command in the terminal

`git clone https://github.com/maadkalzu/PyConsGame.git`

**I hope you all enjoy <3**
